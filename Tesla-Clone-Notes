npx create-react-app tesla-clone --template redux.
click on readme.md and open in intergreated terminal.
npm start

remove whole header from app.js
make a new folder inside src name components and inside compoenents we make Header.js.
then we import the header in app.js

For styling we use styled components.
npm add styled-components
By using styled components we can write our css inside js file and we can also wrap something with any name.

.we put our image folder inside public.

.To create animation we go to index.css.

.In last accessories image we centered a button tell if rightbtntext exists only show that thing {rightBtnText && ....}.

.We install the material ui and import it. go to its site. we install core & Icons.

.In React we use react reveal for animations. checkout its website.
.npm i react-reveal --save --force (for forcing)

.We use useState to close the sidebar.

.Now we are using redux first we go to components and then features and we make a folder inside features and we delete the counter.
.then we go to app inside src and remove the import of counter file from store.js.
.we import the createSlice in carSlice.js.
.it's like slices of pizza so it's like a slices of a car.
